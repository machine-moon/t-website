              Hello! I&apos;m Tarek Ibrahim, a dedicated and passionate software
              developer based in Ottawa, Ontario. Currently pursuing a degree in
              Software Engineering with Co-op at Carleton University,
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a strong passion for software development, with over 5
              years of programming experience across a variety of languages and
              projects. What excites me most about software is the creativity of
              building something from behind a keyboard and the endless
              opportunities for learning and growth. I am constantly seeking to
              learn new technologies and refine my skills. Below are my most
              used languages.
